# My Scala Learning Journey
I do learning-by-doing in this repo, and I make some violations on purpose like the weird package names just to make sure what is the sequence of the contents, so please do not judge me on this :)

## My Main Resources
I'm using multiple resources to study and apply what I learn here with examples. This is a list of **main** resources I use (_I will update this list whenever I use a new resource_):

#### Note:
The order of packages and/or files do not always reflect the natural order of learning these specific topics, but the order I used to learn this piece of information.
